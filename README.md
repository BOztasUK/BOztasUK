## üåü About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate and Data Scientist** with a focus on **advanced deep learning for anti-money laundering**. I have a **First-Class Honours BSc in Mathematics with Finance and Accounting** from Queen Mary University of London and experience in developing and deploying machine learning models in both academic and industry environments.

I thrive in roles where I can leverage data to solve critical problems and create solutions with real-world impact, particularly in financial systems and fintech. I have worked closely with **Danske Bank** to implement AI models for transaction monitoring, presented research at international conferences, and created synthetic datasets now used by other researchers.

### üî¨ Background & Skills

- **Academic Background**: PhD in Computer Science, specialized in anti-money laundering and AI model development.
- **Professional Experience**: Visiting Lecturer on AI, research collaborations with industry (Danske Bank), finance internship experience.
- **Technical Skills**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, PostgreSQL, Chromadb, Streamlit, SQL.
- **Key Interests**: Transaction monitoring, deep learning, feature engineering, and applying AI in finance.

I am passionate about making complex models understandable and useful to stakeholders, and I enjoy bridging gaps between research, business, and application.
