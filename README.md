## üåü About Me

**PhD in Computer Science** researching **advanced deep learning techniques for anti-money laundering**, with a **First-Class Honours BSc in Mathematics with Finance and Accounting** from Queen Mary University of London. Experienced in developing and deploying machine learning models across both academic and industry environments.

Collaborated with Danske Bank on AI models for transaction monitoring, presented research at international conferences, and created synthetic datasets now used by other researchers. Focused on leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive impactful solutions.

    <strong><a href="https://github.com/BOztasUK/Transaction-Monitoring-Project">Tab-AML: Enhancing Money Laundering Detection</a></strong><br/>
    Developed Tab-AML, a transformer-based model for improving anti-money laundering (AML) transaction monitoring. Compared to traditional and deep-learning models, Tab-AML achieved higher AUC score, reduced false positives, and increased true positive rates. Its success is driven by dual-masked transformer encoders, shared embedding, and a residual attention mechanism, proving the effectiveness of transformers in detecting suspicious activities.<br/>

    RAG: Langchain + OpenAI + Chroma + Streamlit is an interactive app for document analysis and question-answering. It supports various document formats, processes data efficiently, and uses embeddings for precise information retrieval. With a user-friendly Streamlit interface, it allows multi-document handling, context-aware responses, and cost estimation, making it ideal for analysing reports like the Bank of England‚Äôs Financial Stability Report.<br/>
